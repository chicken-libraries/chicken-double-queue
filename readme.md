# üêì Chicken Double Ended Queue

## About

* * *

Small lightweight package focused on providing an easy to use API for a double ended
queue.

## Tooling information

* * *

Targeted audience we are building for is Windows 10, MacOSX and Linux users. This
project uses [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) `0.56.0` and newer.

## Setup, Compile and Install

* * *

Using this package should be fairly simple just add the git wrap file in your subprojects
directory and include the dependency in your project.

```console
[wrap-git]
directory = chicken-double-queue
url = https://github.com/chicken-libraries/chicken-double-queue.git
revision = main
```


The next step should be to add the package to your Meson project:

```meson
chicken_double_queue = subproject('chicken-double-queue')

executable('prog', files('main.c'),
    dependencies : [chicken_double_queue.get_variable('chicken_double_queue_dep')])

```

And finally we setup, and compile the project just like normal.

## Usage of this package

* * *

Here is a simple sample application that should get you up and running with using this
library as soon as possible but to learn more please view the API documentation thanks.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <chicken/double-queue.h>

//
// main is where all good examples start
//
int main(void)
{
    DeQueueOf *mQueue = chickenDeQueueCreate();
    if (chickenDeQueueItsEmpty(mQueue))
    {
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    } // end if
    chickenDeQueuePushStart(mQueue, "hello");
    chickenDeQueuePushStart(mQueue, "crazy");
    chickenDeQueuePushStart(mQueue, "world");

    while (chickenDeQueueNotEmpty(mQueue))
    {
        printf("%s ", chickenDeQueuePeekStart(mQueue));
        chickenDeQueuePopStart(mQueue);
    } // end while
    chickenDeQueueErase(&mQueue);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
} // end of function main

```
